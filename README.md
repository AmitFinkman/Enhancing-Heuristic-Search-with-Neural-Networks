# Enhancing Heuristic Search with Neural Networks
Heuristic search algorithms, such as A*, Weighted A* (WA*), and Batch Weighted A* (BWA*), are crucial for solving complex combinatorial problems, where the effectiveness of the heuristic significantly impacts the efficiency and success of the search process. These algorithms rely on heuristics to guide the search towards the goal state, balancing exploration and exploitation to enhance performance. Traditionally, heuristics are static and manually designed, limiting their adaptability and optimization potential.

In this project, we explore the use of neural networks to learn heuristics through a bootstrapping method. The neural network is trained to predict heuristic values based on data generated by a basic heuristic and applied within search algorithms like A*, WA*, and BWA*. While the learned heuristic may not be admissible—due to possible overestimations by the neural network—our objective is to harness the flexibility and learning capabilities of neural networks to develop a heuristic that leads to fewer node expansions on average compared to the traditional heuristic.

We apply this approach to the TopSpin puzzle, a challenging combinatorial problem, to demonstrate how integrating neural networks into the heuristic search process can significantly enhance search efficiency. Our goal is to show that a search algorithm utilizing learned heuristics will expand fewer nodes on average than one using a basic heuristic, thereby improving overall search performance even if the learned heuristic does not guarantee admissibility.
